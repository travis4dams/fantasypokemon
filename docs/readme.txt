----- Introduction -----

The docs folder is meant to contain documents that support the project and provide information to the developers or users. Docs typically should not provide data to the program; that is instead what the "res" folder is intended for. As such spreadsheets typically don't belong here basically unless they are meant to be just read by humans.
